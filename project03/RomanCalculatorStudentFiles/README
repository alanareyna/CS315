My code goes through an infinite loop in main where I loop until the token hits end of line. When you run the code it
processes the expression, but it won't go past that while loop to evaluate or print it. It will add to the map successfully
as well and would function properly if it got past the while loop. I was able to make it print the solved evaluation
before I made changes to my main. The rest of my code, to the best of my knowledge, works properly.
